# To-Good-List
A list of ideas for the community to take and contribute towards. Some of these can be fun ideas for hackathons and some can even be made into startups.

I've been brainstorming and came up with a lot of ideas for tech for social good. Instead of keeping them all to myself and never be able to complete all of them, I've decide to culminate all of my ideas and share them with the community. In addition, create a place where people who have similar ideas can collaborate in turning these ideas into reality.

If you are working on your versions of these ideas, feel free to link your repositories here for other people to join your team and contribute.

If you have suggestions for new ideas please keep in mind that your idea should align with the fundamental goal of this list. Will this help people become better humans? I understand that people have different definitions, but really ask yourself that question before you make a suggestion.
